    )

Estimate the importance of the given `feature_name`.
The aim is to satisfy the following property, so that the features can be
ordered by importance:

> Given two features A and B, if A has more effect on the outcome, then
> feature_importance(model, A) > feature_importance(model, B).

This is based on the [`gap_size`](@ref) function. The gap size is the
difference between the then and otherwise (else) probabilities. A smaller gap
size implies a smaller CART-splitting criterion, which implies a smaller
occurrence frequency (see the appendix at
<https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/benard21a.html> for an example).

!!! note
    This function provides only an importance _estimate_ because the effect on
    the outcome depends on the data.
