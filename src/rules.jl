    SubClause

A subclause denotes a conditional on one feature.
Each rule contains a clause with one or more subclauses.
For example, the rule `if X[i, 1] > 3 & X[i, 2] < 4, then ...` contains two subclauses.

A subclause is equivalent to a split in a decision tree.
In other words, each rule is based on one or more subclauses.
In pratice, a rule is based on at most two subclauses (has at most two subclauses).
The reason for this is that rules with more than two subclauses will not end up
in the final model, as is discussed in the original SIRUS paper.

The data inside a `SubClause` can be accessed via

- `_feature`,
- `_feature_name`,
- `_splitval`, and
- `_direction`.

To obtain the reverse, use `_reverse`.

Note:
this name is not perfect.
A formally better name would be "predicate atom", but that takes more
characters and is also not very intuitive.
Instead, the word `Clause` and `SubClause` seem pretty short and clear.

    Clause

A clause denotes a conditional on one or more features.
Each rule contains a clause with one or more subclauses.

A clause is equivalent to a path in a decision tree.
For example, the clause `X[i, 1] > 3 & X[i, 2] < 4` can be interpreted as a path
going through two nodes.

In the original SIRUS paper, a path of length `d` is defined as consisting of `d` subclauses.
As discussed above, in practice the number of subclauses or subclauses `d ≤ 2`.

Note that a path can also be a path to a node; not necessarily a leaf.

Data can be accessed via `_subclauses`.
