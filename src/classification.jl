    _gini(y::AbstractVector, classes::AbstractVector)

Return the Gini index for a vector outcomes `y` and `classes`.
Here, `y` is usually a view on the outcome values in some region.
Inside that region, `gini` is a measure of node purity.
If all values in the region have the same class, then gini is zero.
The equation is mentioned on Wikipedia as
``1 - \\sum{class \\in classes} p_i^2,``
where ``p_i`` denotes the fraction (proportion) of items labeled
with class ``i`` in the set.
