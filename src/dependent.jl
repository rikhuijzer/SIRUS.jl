"""
Return whether each rule in `rules` is linearly dependent on a combination of rules before it.
This works by iteratively calculating the rank and seeing whether the rank increases.

To generate points for the rank calculation, assume that we are limited to a set of rules where either `A & B`, `A & !B`, `!A & B`, `!A & !B`, `A`, `!A`, `B`, `!B` or `True`.
This last case is not a valid rule in this algorithm, so that will not happen.
Now, given `A` and `B`, we can create a binary matrix with a row for `A & B`, `A & !B`, `!A & B`, `!A & !B`.
Next, generate one column containing `true`s and one column for each rule in `rules`.
In each column, answer whether the rule holds for some point that satisifies the conditional.
This trick of taking specifically these rows is briliant.
